        <p><strong>Album of the Day</strong> is a fun way for music lovers in your discord to share and discover albums together, one day at a time!</p>

        <p className="text-lg">How it works:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Submit albums you love</strong> - Backed by the the <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-500 hover:underline">MusicBrainz</a> database. It keeps things clean and consistent with proper album info and cover art.</li>
          <li><strong>Every day, we pick one at random</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Everyone can listen and share their thoughts</strong> - whether its a detailed review, a quick reaction, or just a rating. Its all about hearing different perspectives on music.</li>
